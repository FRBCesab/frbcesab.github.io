The [CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) 
– Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity – is a key program of the [FRB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/) (Foundation for Research on Biodiversity) 
and is an original, innovative and internationally recognized tool that offers 
researchers a place and time to synthesize and analyze already existing data and 
information in the field of biodiversity research.

Since it was created in 2010, the CESAB has been collecting and pooling existing 
data and information in the field of biodiversity in order to assess the state 
of biodiversity and model its future. 
[CESAB working groups](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/) 
are composed of international researchers and coordinated by a researcher 
affiliated with a French research structure.

After pooling and studying existing data on biodiversity, 
[CESAB working groups](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/) 
publish their work in [peer-reviewed scientific articles](content/publications.html) 
to share with the international scientific community.
