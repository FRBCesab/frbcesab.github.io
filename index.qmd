## Resources developed by FRB-CESAB researchers



::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
By encouraging its groups of researchers to share the tools and databases 
developed as part of their work, the FRB-CESAB is supporting open science since 
the centre opened in 2010.

The [CESAB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/about-the-foundation/le-cesab/) 
– Centre for the Synthesis and Analysis of Biodiversity – is a key program of the [FRB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/) (Foundation for Research on Biodiversity) 
and is an original, innovative and internationally recognized tool that offers 
researchers a place and time to synthesize and analyze already existing data and 
information in the field of biodiversity research.

Since it was created in 2010, the CESAB has been collecting and pooling existing 
data and information in the field of biodiversity in order to assess the state 
of biodiversity and model its future. CESAB groups are composed of international 
researchers and coordinated by a researcher affiliated with a French research 
structure.

After pooling and studying existing data on biodiversity, 
[CESAB groups](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/) 
publish their work in peer-reviewed scientific articles to share with 
the international scientific community.
