**Abstract**

There is now compelling evidence that species across diverse taxonomic groups and regions are responding to climate change by shifting their geographical ranges, with far-reaching consequences for ecosystem functioning and human well-being. However, substantial variability remains in how, where, and why species shift, and much of this variation is still unexplained. The overarching goal of [Bioshifts](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bioshifts/) was to deepen our understanding of the processes driving range shifts, ultimately improving our capacity to forecast and manage the consequences of biodiversity redistribution under climate change. Drawing on a comprehensive geo-database of range-shift estimates compiled from the scientific literature and enriched with climate-velocity metrics and methodological descriptors (the "BioShifts" database), [Bioshifts](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bioshifts/) investigated the global patterns and mechanisms of biodiversity redistribution. This included examining the influence of climate exposure, habitat constraints, species traits, and evolutionary processes. The findings of [Bioshifts](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bioshifts/) provide new insight into the conditions under which commonly used niche-based models produce reliable forecasts of species redistributions, and how species traits and macroevolutionary processes shape contemporary range shifts.
