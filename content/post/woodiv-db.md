The WOODIV database provides reliable occurrences, four functional traits (plant height, seed mass, wood density, and specific leaf area), and sequences from three DNA-regions (rbcL, matK, and trnH-psbA), together with modelled occurrences and a phylogeny for all 210 Euro-Mediterranean tree species (INSPIRE-compliant 10 Ã— 10 km grid).

This work is part of the CESAB working group [**WOODIV**](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/woodiv/)
