The RAINBIO mega database contains high quality georeferenced occurrences of vascular plants from sub-Saharan tropical Africa. It is a compilation of thirteen public and non-public databases made available under the RAINBIO project funded by CESAB. The database was filtered, quality-checked and verified by the CESAB RAINBIO Consortium. The database holds 610,117 georeferenced occurrences for 25,356 species of vascular plants and 29,659 taxa (including subspecies and varieties), 3,158 genera, and 273 families.

This work is part of the CESAB working group [**RAINBIO**](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/rainbio/)
