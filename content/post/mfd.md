The `mFD` package provides a **user friendly** interface to compute a global assessment of functional diversity by gathering computation of alpha and beta functional indices. As no package before, it guides users through functional analysis with one function per action to complete, several arguments that can be changed and allows personalized graphical outputs. Various tutorials are available on the `mFD` website to guide the user through the functional workflow.
