<br/>

**Abstract**

Fish biodiversity under global change – a worldwide assessment from scientific 
trawl surveys Global change, linked to climate and direct anthropogenic impacts,
is causing redistribution of marine species worldwide, modifying fish population
and stock structure, as well as community compositions. These changes may have
strong impacts on fisheries and natural fish biodiversity as well as related
ecosystem services. However, our capacity to assess and monitor short and
long-term changes in species distribution and biodiversity is hampered by data
availability and heterogeneity. This Cesabinar will present the 
[FISHGLOB](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/fishglob/)
project which has collected and combined a unique data set of scientific bottom trawl
surveys conducted regularly during the last decades across the globe. FISHGLOB
aims to provide an infrastructure enhancing international cooperation and
knowledge transfer among data providers, scientists and stakeholders in order
to support biodiversity and fishery management adaptation in a time of global
change. Topics during the Cesabinar will cover the FISHGLOB consortium, data
and infrastructure features, as well as key research results established from
this large and unique data set regarding the effects of global change on marine
fish.

<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [BRIDGE](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bridge/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

The [BRIDGE](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bridge/) project aimed to better understand the role of local and regional environmental factors in shaping the taxonomic and functional diversity of plant communities established along river corridors, roadside corridors and cultivated field margins. It gathered partners from the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Canada and the U.S.A. The analysis of local and regional patterns was conducted from a database including 11,400 field samples (plots) and about 3,000 species characterized by ecological traits.
The analysis of the role of river-road intersections showed that bridges do influence taxonomic and functional biodiversity, but only at a local scale. Surprisingly, diffuse landscape-level processes explain more plant diversity than directional (along-corridor) processes. We showed that the diversity of roadside should not be underestimated, and more generally that the three interacting habitats studied share many species and trait values, suggesting they can constitute surrogate relays for hosting similar species across the landscape. However, local conditions of disturbance and water and nutrient availability modulate this potential interaction.

The [BRIDGE](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/bridge/) and [NAVIDIV](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/navidiv/) FRB-CESAB-ITTECOP projects joined to produce a synthesis on the role of transportation infrastructure in helping plant species to track Global Climate change, highlighting both positive and negative aspects of this phenomenon.

## [07] Inland navigation infrastructures and biodiversity: impacts and opportunities for waterwayscape management
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; March 2025

<br/>

**Abstract**

Facing global change, inland navigation transport is considered as one of the most promising, sustainable transport alternatives to help operate the world ecological transition and achieve climate neutrality. Waterways thus must develop their infrastructures to promote green transport alternatives. However, ecomorphological modifications of rivers will affect biodiversity status and resilience. With the stated objective to sustainable management of waterways, the question therefore remains: what are the impacts of inland navigation on biodiversity, and how to mitigate them? ​

Cues currently available to solve this question rely on scattered case studies whose results are highly context- and scale-dependent. In addition, our knowledge of the processes driving navigation- biodiversity relationships is still limited and requires further research. We thus realised a synthesis project to study the relationships between navigation activity, the associated Inland Navigation Infrastructures (INIs), and biodiversity across different contexts and scales.

Our specific aims are to: (i) Quantify and hierarchize the effects of navigation and INIs on taxonomic and functional biodiversity; (ii) Evaluate the context-dependency and scale-dependency of the INIs-biodiversity ​ relationships; (iii) Assess the potential of restoration plans in mitigating navigation pressures. ​

This work provides impact assessment and synthetic knowledge, offering guidelines on how to prioritize management and restoration actions depending on the context and on which scales to conceive policies that ensure consistency across territories.

## [06] Spatio-temporal variability of coral reefs at the global scale: causalities, idiosyncrasies and implications for ecological indicators 
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; January 2025

<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Valeriano PARRAVICINI** (EPHE, CRIOBE, France)
<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [SCORE-REEF](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/score-reef/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

Coral reefs host the highest marine biodiversity and provide crucial services that sustain 500 million people worldwide. However, reefs are degrading rapidly due to the overlap between climate-induced disturbances and chronic stress. While reefs are recovering from the most prolonged global coral die-off on record (2015-2016), the effect of multiple stressors is still hard to disentangle and managers or conservation practitioners are charged to take decisions in a context of high uncertainty. Solving this issue would require the development of a set of complementary indicators that evaluate the status of reefs considering the taxonomic and the functional facets of biodiversity. These should be built using large-scale and long-term datasets to capture a wide range of environmental, biogeographical and anthropogenic conditions.
In [SCORE-REEF](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/score-reef/), we merged and analysed global-scale and long-term datasets deriving from monitoring programs running in the French Overseas Territories and other regions. We evaluated the relevance and inter-operability of available datasets and assessed the temporal dynamics of benthic and fish assemblages using taxonomic and functional approaches. We then discuss the relevance of indicators used within the European Water Framework Directive, IFRECOR and MPAs monitoring, paving the way to the development of region-tailored indicators.

## [05] Foraminifera response to climatic stress: Evaluating biodiversity changes of calcifying zooplankton in response to multiple stressors
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; December 2024
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Sonia CHAABANE** (CEREGE, CNRS, France)
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Thibault DE GARIDEL-THORON** (CEREGE, CNRS, France)
<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [FORCIS](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/forcis/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

Rising CO2 emissions are driving ocean warming and acidification, disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening calcifying organisms like planktonic foraminifera. These organisms, with their well-preserved fossils in sediments, serve as excellent paleo-environmental indicators. However, their ability to adapt to the rapid pace of modern environmental changes remains uncertain, and a global-scale assessment of their historical distribution is lacking.
The [FORCIS](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/forcis/) project addressed these uncertainties by compiling a comprehensive database of planktonic foraminifera diversity and distribution from 1910 to the present. With over 180,000 samples collected from various depths and sampling devices, this dataset enabled analyses of species abundance across size classes, and depth. A new size normalization scheme facilitated comparisons across data sampled with different mesh sizes.
Our analysis revealed clear evidence of poleward migrations, with species diversity increasing at mid- to high-latitudes and some species moving deeper into the water column to escape warming surface waters. Additionally, foraminifera abundance declined by 24% over the past eight decades at these latitudes. Projections for ocean conditions in 2050 and 2100 suggest that low-latitude species will face conditions beyond their historical and present ecological range.
Ecological niche modeling, using ESM and GRNN models, indicates that these species distribution will likely continue shifting poleward, reducing foraminiferal diversity in tropical and subtropical regions. Shifting alone may be insufficient for those species to cope with anthropic changes.

## [04] From reproductive strategies to species diversity: How evolution of breeding systems and associated traits shapes plant species diversity?
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; November 2024
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Sylvain GLEMIN** (ECOBIO, Rennes, France)
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Jos KAFER** (ISEM, Montpellier, France)
<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [DIVERS](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/divers/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

Angiosperms (flowering plants) present an exceptional diversity of breeding systems, with variation both in gender distribution within and among individuals (from hermaphroditism to separate sexes) and in mating patterns (from strict outcrossing to predominant selfing). Breeding systems were shown to affect species diversification and to be associated with other life-history and ecological traits. Consequently, these systems could have been an important determinant of the observed species diversity in flowering plants.<br/>
The [DIVERS](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/divers/) project aimed to explore the hypothesis that the combination of traits associated with breeding systems could be a key factor in understanding evolutionary success and plant species diversity. This project sought to define integrated evolutionary strategies among these traits and to investigate how these strategies could shape the diversification process in flowering plants. This approach helped identify key components that could explain why some groups of flowering plants are more diverse than others and how combinations of traits could influence invasiveness and extinction risks.

## [03] Functional rarity: From detection to conservation
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; October 2024
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Cyrille VIOLLE** (CEFE-CNRS, Montpellier, France)
<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [FREE 1](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/free/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

Rarity has always fascinated conservation and evolutionary biologists with the goal to uncover species characteristics causing extinction risk. Recently, some results suggest that rare species may over-contribute to the diversity of traits within communities thus supporting irreplaceable roles while others show that rare species are functionally redundant with common species. Beyond the rarity of species, the rarity of functions played by species, coined as functional rarity, is thus key to understand the impact of biodiversity decline on ecosystem functioning. However, functional rarity still lacks a clear definition and a quantitative framework while its emergence and maintenance within communities is largely unknown.<br/>
As part of the FRB-CESAB [FREE 1](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/free/) working group, we have contributed to advance the concept of functional rarity and examine the causes and consequences of functional rarity from local to global scales. We showed that common assumptions notwithstanding, rare species can play unique and essential ecological roles, and that ecologically rare species are already more threatened by humans than ecologically common species and will be more impacted by future climate change. Finally, we highlighted that, in most taxonomic groups, hotspots of functional rarity differ from the areas where the most vulnerable species are found. This has major implications for species and ecosystem conservation where functional rarity appears to be an additional criterion to be considered urgently for the establishment of lists of so-called species at risk and for deciding on the location and size of areas to be protected.

## [02] Dynamic resource landscapes, ecological feedbacks and the emergence of meta-food webs
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; September 2024
<br/>{{< fa user >}}&nbsp; **Isabelle GOUNAND** (CNRS, iEES-Paris, France)
<br/>{{< fa globe >}}&nbsp; [RED-BIO](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/red-bio/) project

<br/>

**Abstract**

Biodiversity and abiotic resource distribution are intrinsically intertwined. Resource distribution influences productivity and biodiversity, but animal movement also redistributes resources across landscapes. Metaecosystem theory integrates this dynamic feedback between biological communities and abiotic resources, but classically considers predefined fixed habitat patches. The assumption of fixed patches, however, does not match well with patterns observed in natural food webs where mobile organisms of different trophic levels forage across contrasting spatial scales.<br/>
[RED-BIO](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/red-bio/) synthesizes principles from meta-food web and metaecosystem theory to develop an integrated modelling framework of food web dynamics in spatially explicit landscapes. We began with a spatially explicit extension of a resource-plant-herbivore occupancy model, where habitat patches emerge from ecological feedbacks rather than being pre-defined and fixed. With this model, we investigate in which conditions dispersal and foraging scales of organisms drive the emergence of resource heterogeneity.<br/>
Future extension should include a body size-based version enabling to integrate food web complexity and evolutionary potential, in order to let the spatial and temporal heterogeneity emerge from both ecological interactions between animal movement and resource recycling, and eco-evolutionary feedbacks under global change.

## [01] Towards 'just conservation': Linking theories and practices of justice in biodiversity conservation
<hr />

{{< fa calendar-days >}}&nbsp; June 2024

<br/>

**Abstract**

From 2018 to 2023, the [JUSTCONSERVATION](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/justconservation/) group has worked on reviewing the science on 50 years of biodiversity conservation. As conservation initiatives expand in response to biodiversity loss, there remains limited understanding about what forms of governance and roles for different actors produce the best social-ecological outcomes.<br/>
Drawing on evidence collected from 723 studies published in English-language peer-reviewed journals that describe and explore conservation efforts at a single site in 104 countries, we took stock of the geography of knowledge production in conservation science and studied its effect in upholding longstanding narratives about what should be conserved and by whom. We also explored relationships between conservation initiative types, governance types (including different levels of influence by Indigenous Peoples and local communities), and reported social and ecological outcomes.<br/>
Findings reveal that positive ecological and social outcomes are strongly associated with higher levels of influence of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and their institutions, implying equity in conservation practice should be advanced not only for moral reasons but because it can also enhance conservation effectiveness.
