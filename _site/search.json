CESAB groups are composed of international researchers and coordinated by a researcher affiliated with a French research structure.\nAfter pooling and studying existing data on biodiversity, CESAB groups publish their work in numerous peer-reviewed scientific articles to share with the international scientific community.\nBy encouraging its groups of researchers to share the tools and databases developed as part of their work, the FRB-CESAB is supporting open science since the centre opened in 2010."
